# Flutter Productivity App

## Overview
A comprehensive productivity application designed to enhance personal productivity by helping users manage daily activities and finances. The app features two core modulesâ€”Personal Management and Financial Managementâ€”with an offline-first approach, biometric authentication, multi-language support (English and Hindi), and a consistent UI with light and dark themes. Data syncs with a Node.js backend when online, based on user-configurable sync settings.
