### 🎯 Refactoring Goal

**What needs refactoring?**
Clearly describe what part of the codebase needs restructuring.

**Files/Modules affected:**
- `lib/...`
- `test/...`
- Other: ___________

### 🚨 Why is this necessary?

**Current Problems:**
- [ ] Performance issues
- [ ] Code readability/maintainability
- [ ] Code duplication
- [ ] Poor test coverage
- [ ] Architectural concerns
- [ ] Security issues
- [ ] Outdated dependencies
- [ ] Memory leaks
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Technical Debt Impact:**
- Development velocity is slowed
- Bug fixing is difficult
- Adding new features is complex
- Code is hard to understand

### 💡 Proposed Changes

**High-level approach:**
Describe the refactoring approach and key changes.

**Detailed Changes:**
1. **File Structure:**
   - Move X to Y
   - Rename Z to A
   - Extract B into separate module

2. **Code Changes:**
   - Replace pattern X with Y
   - Introduce design pattern Z
   - Update method signatures

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Update package X to version Y
   - Remove unused dependency Z
   - Add new package A for purpose B

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

**Current Architecture Issues:**
- Tight coupling between components
- Missing abstraction layers
- Inconsistent patterns

**Proposed Architecture:**
- Introduce clean architecture layers
- Implement dependency injection
- Add proper error handling

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

**Current Testing Issues:**
- [ ] Low test coverage
- [ ] Flaky tests
- [ ] Hard to test code
- [ ] Missing integration tests

**Testing Improvements:**
- [ ] Add unit tests for new structure
- [ ] Improve test coverage to X%
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Improve test performance

### 📊 Impact Assessment

**Breaking Changes:**
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Minor API changes
- [ ] Major API restructuring
- [ ] Database migration required

**Risk Level:**
- [ ] Low risk - isolated changes
- [ ] Medium risk - affects multiple components
- [ ] High risk - core architecture changes

**Estimated Effort:**
- [ ] Small (< 1 day)
- [ ] Medium (1-3 days)
- [ ] Large (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Epic (> 2 weeks)

### 🔄 Migration Strategy

**How to implement this safely:**
1. Phase 1: ...
2. Phase 2: ...
3. Phase 3: ...

**Rollback Plan:**
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Feature flags for new implementation
- Keep old code until migration is complete

### 📈 Success Metrics

**How will we measure success?**
- [ ] Performance improvement: X% faster
- [ ] Code coverage increase: X% to Y%
- [ ] Reduced cyclomatic complexity
- [ ] Faster build times
- [ ] Reduced bundle size
- [ ] Improved developer productivity
